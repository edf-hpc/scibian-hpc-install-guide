== Conventions

In order to restrain the complexicity of the configuration a Scibian HPC
cluster, some naming and architecture conventions have been defined. Multiple
components of the software stack expect these conventions to be followed in
order to operate properly. These conventions are actually rather close to HPC
cluster standards, then they should not seem very constraining.

* The operating system short hostname of the nodes must have the following
  format: `<prefix><role><id>`. This is required by the node to Puppet role
  association logic in Puppet-HPC. This point is fully explained in the role
  section of Puppet-HPC reference documentation.
* The FQDNfootnote:[Fully-Qualified Domain Name] hostnames of the nodes must be
  similar to their network names on the administration network. In other words,
  the IP address resolution on the cluster of the FQDN hostname of a node must
  return the IP address of this node on the administration network.
