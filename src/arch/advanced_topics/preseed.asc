=== Debian Installer Preseed Generator ===

By default on Scibian HPC clusters, the URL provided in the bootmenu entries
for the Debian installer preseed (`scibian*-disk-*` entries) is actually
directed to a Python CGI script `preseedator.py`. This behaviour can be altered
by overriding the respective menu entries, please refer to <<arch-adv-bootmenu,
iPXE Bootmenu Generator>> section for explanations.

This CGI script `preseedator.py` dynamically generate a preseed for Debian
installer for the node given in parameter. This CGI script is provided by the
`scibian-hpc-netboot-preseedator` package.

In the first place, the script reads the nodes boot parameters located in file
`/etc/scibian-hpc-netboot/boot-params.yaml`. Please refer to <<arch-adv-bootmenu,
iPXE Bootmenu Generator>> section to understand how this file is built.

Then, it parses its YAML configuration file
`/etc/scibian-hpc-netboot/installer/installer.yaml`. This file basically
contains all debian installer related parameters such as the URL to the APT
mirror/proxy and the list of additional repositories. The content of this file
is based on the following inputs:

- the default values provided by Puppet-HPC _boothttp_ module within
  `installer_options_defaults` parameter,
- the list of additional APT repositories computed by Puppet-HPC
  `bootsystem::server` extracted from Hiera in
  `profiles::cluster::apt_sources` hash parameter.
- the `profiles::bootsystem::installer_options` hash parameter in Hiera
  repository.

Finally, the `preseedator.py` script generates the preseed based on the
template file `/etc/scibian-hpc-netboot/installer/preseed.jinja2`. The template
is filled with parameters previously loaded.

The template provides a mechanism to download an external partition schema file
from the installation server (`diskinstall_server` in `boot-params.yaml`). The
URL directs to an another Python CGI script `partitioner.py`. This script is
also provided by `scibian-hpc-netboot-preseedator` package.

This script searches for a partition schema file in directory
`/etc/scibian-hpc-netboot/installer/schemas` in the following order:

. `nodes/<node>` where `<node>` is the hostname of the node,
. `roles/<role>` where `<role>` is the role name of the node,
. `common`

The first found file is returned by the script. By default, only the `common`
file is provided by the package. With Puppet-HPC, it is possible to deploy node
or role specific schemas by setting the `boothttp::partition_schemas` array in
Hiera repository.
