=== Directory replica

User authentication on Scibian HPC clusters is based on LDAP directory using
ldaps protocol (LDAP over SSL/TLS). This protocol requires the LDAP replica to
have valid SSL certificate and asymmetric keys.

For production use, it is recommended to obtain a certificate signed by a valid
PKI CAfootnote:[Public Key Infrastructure Certicate of Authority, an entity that
issues digital certificates], either a public CA on the Internet or a CA
internal to your organization. Otherwise, it is possible to use self-signed
certificates.

Copy the private key and the certificate under the following paths:

* certificate: `$ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/files/$CLUSTER/auth/$CLUSTER_ldap.crt`
* private key: `$ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/files/$CLUSTER/auth/$CLUSTER_ldap.key`

Encrypt these files with clara _enc_ plugin:

----
# clara enc `$ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/files/$CLUSTER/auth/$CLUSTER_ldap.crt`
# clara enc `$ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/files/$CLUSTER/auth/$CLUSTER_ldap.key`
----

Remove the unencrypted files:

----
# rm `$ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/files/$CLUSTER/auth/$CLUSTER_ldap.crt`
# rm `$ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/files/$CLUSTER/auth/$CLUSTER_ldap.key`
----

Then, append the `auth::replica` profile and set certificate owner to `openldap`
in the _proxy_ role:

Finally, follow the steps documented in <<bootstrap-ldap, LDAP bootstrap

=== Clients setup

Once the LDAP replica are bootstrapped and operational, it is possible to setup
NSS LDAP backend and PAM LDAP authentication on the nodes.

On Scibian HPC clusters, NSS LDAP backend and PAM authentication over LDAP are
both setup with the same `auth::client` profile. This profile must be used in
combination with the `access::base` profile. This profile controls the remote
access rules to the nodes. By default, the profile prevents remote access to the
nodes with LDAP accounts. The access rules must explicitely whitelist users
and/or administrators to allow remote access with SSH.

There are two main access whitelist parameters:

* `profiles::access:base_options` is the list of permanent access rules.
* `profiles::access:production_options` is the list of access rules disabled in
  maintenance mode.

The administrators related access rules must be listed in the `base_options`
while the users related access rules must only be present in the
`production_options` list. This way, only administrators can access the HPC
cluster in maintenance mode. For example:

----
profiles::access::base_options:
  - "+ : (admins) : ALL"
profiles::access::production_options:
  - "+ : (grpusers1) : ALL"
  - "+ : (grpusers2) : ALL"
----

These parameters must be set in the roles specific layer of the hiera repository
as access rules depends on the role of the nodes. For example, users may access
the frontend nodes but not the admin node.

Additionally, it is also possible to setup sudo rules with the `sudo::base`
profile and the `sudo::sudo_config_opts` list. This parameter is basically a
list of sudo rules. For example, to allow the group of administrator to sudo any
command on the admin node, add the following excerpt to file
`$ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/hieradata/$CLUSTER/roles/admin.yaml`:

----
profiles::sudo::sudo_config_opts:
  - "%admins ALL = (ALL) ALL"
----

By default, the PAM and NSS LDAP backend connect to the HPC cluster internal
LDAP replica. This replica is hosted by service virtual machine. In order to
make LDAP authentication on the admin nodes and generic service nodes possible
for the administrators when the virtual machines are offline (typically during
maintenances), it is possible to add the following parameter in the associated
roles:

----
profiles::auth::client::external_ldap: true
----

This way, the nodes will connect to the organization reference LDAP directory
instead of the internal LDAP replica.

Push and apply the configuration on all the affected nodes with:

----
# hpc-config-push && clush -bg all hpc-config-apply
----
