=== Base system installation

The other generic service nodes must now be rebooted in PXE mode to run the
Debian installer and configure the base system:

[source,sh]
----
for BMC in $(nodeset -O bmc%s -e service[2-4]); do
    ipmitool -I lanplus -U ADMIN -P ADMIN -H $BMC chassis bootdev pxe
    ipmitool -I lanplus -U ADMIN -P ADMIN -H $BMC power reset
done
----

Replace the BMC credentials with the appropriate values.

////
FIXME: it would be nice to replace these ipmitool commands with a new high-level
software as discussed in https://github.com/edf-hpc/clara/issues/58
////

IMPORTANT: Scibian provides a default network installation system designed to
work in most situations. However, at this point, you may need to tune this
system to make it work on your cluster and its hardware setup. Please refer to
<<production-boot>> for the procedures.

Once the base system is fully installed, the nodes reboot and become available
with SSH. Check this with:

----
# clush -bw fbservice[2-4] uname
---------------
fbservice[2-4] (3)
---------------
Linux
----

At this stage, all generic services nodes are available to host the configuration
environments. The parameters of the `hpc-config-push` utility can be updated to
switch from _posix_ to _sftp_. In this mode, the utility will upload the
configuration environment on all generic service nodes. Edit
`$ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/hieradata/$CLUSTER/cluster.yaml` file to update the
`hpconfig::push::config_options` hash with the following changes:

[source,diff]
----
 hpcconfig::push::config_options:
   global:
     cluster:     "%{::cluster_name}"
-    mode:        'posix'
+    mode:        'sftp'
     destination: "%{hiera('profiles::http::system::docroot')}/hpc-config"
     areas:       'infra,user'
+  sftp:
+    hosts:       'fbservice1,fbservice2,fbservice3,fbservice4'
+    private_key: '/root/.ssh/id_rsa_root'
----

Then push and apply the configuration on the first service node:

[source,bash]
----
cd $ADMIN && hpc-config-push && hpc-config-apply -v
----

This will update `/etc/hpc-config/push.conf` configuration file.

Then run this command again to upload the configuration environment on all
service nodes:

[source,bash]
----
cd $ADMIN && hpc-config-push
----

Starting from now, all generic service nodes can be used as a valid source for
the configuration environments.
