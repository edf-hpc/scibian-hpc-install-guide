=== Puppet configuration

The `hpc-config-push` Puppet-HPC utility expects to find a Puppet and Hiera
configuration files for the cluster under the `puppet-config` directory of the
internal configuration repository. Simply copy examples configuration files
provided with Puppet-HPC:

----
cp $ADMIN/puppet-hpc/examples/privatedata/{puppet.conf,hiera.yaml} \
   $ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/puppet-config/$CLUSTER/
----

The `hiera.yaml` file notably specifies the layers of YAML files composing the
hiera repository. It can eventually be tuned for additional layer to fit your
needs.

Puppet-HPC requires the cluster name to be a _fact_ (according to
https://docs.puppet.com/facter/[Facter]). For this purpose, define the file
`$ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/puppet-config/$CLUSTER/hpc-config-facts.yaml` with the
following content:

[source,yaml]
----
---
cluster_name: 'foobar'
----

This YAML file is deployed by Puppet-HPC `hpc-config-{push,apply}` on every
nodes in `/var/lib/puppet/facts.d` directory. The content of the YAML files
located this directory are considered as valid custom facts.

Eventually, additional arbitrary custom facts can be defined for the cluster in
this file at your convenience.
