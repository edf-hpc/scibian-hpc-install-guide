=== Service role

The Puppet role `service` associated to the generic service nodes must be
defined with the corresponding profiles. This is achieved by initializing file
`$ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/hieradata/$CLUSTER/roles/service.yaml` with the
following content:

[source,yaml]
----
include::../../examples/service_role.yaml[]
----

The first profiles (below the _common_ comment) are common to all nodes of the
cluster. The profiles after the _HW host_ comment are common to all bare metal
nodes. The last profiles, after the _service_ comment, carry the base services
hosted by the generic service nodes.

The last parameter `profiles::network::gw_connect` defines on which network's
gateway the nodes use as their default route.

NOTE: this last parameter can be removed once this bug is fixed:
