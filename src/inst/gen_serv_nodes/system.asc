=== Base system installation

The other generic service nodes must now be rebooted in PXE mode to run the
Debian installer and configure the base system:

[source,sh]
----
for BMC in $(nodeset -O bmc%s -e service[2-4]); do
    ipmitool -I lanplus -U ADMIN -P ADMIN -H $BMC chassis bootdev pxe
    ipmitool -I lanplus -U ADMIN -P ADMIN -H $BMC power reset
done
----

Replace the BMC credentials with the appropriate values.

////
FIXME: it would be nice to replace these ipmitool commands with a new high-level
software as discussed in https://github.com/edf-hpc/clara/issues/58
////

IMPORTANT: Scibian provides a default network installation system designed to
work in most situations. However, at this point, you may need to tune this
system to make it work on your cluster and its hardware setup. Please refer to
<<production-boot>> for the procedures.

Once the base system is fully installed, the nodes reboot and become available
with SSH. Check this with:

----
# clush -bw fbservice[2-4] uname
---------------
fbservice[2-4] (3)
---------------
Linux
----
