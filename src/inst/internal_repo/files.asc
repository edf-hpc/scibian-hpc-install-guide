=== Initial files

There are few files that are required in the cluster's file directory of the
internal configuration repository to deploy the generic service nodes.

First, create the needed sub-directories:

----
mkdir -p $ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/files/$CLUSTER/boot/ipxe \
         $ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/files/$CLUSTER/boot/disk-installer/scibian9 \
         $ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/files/$CLUSTER/ha
----

Download the Debian network installer archive:

----
# wget http://deb.debian.org/debian/dists/jessie/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/netboot.tar.gz \
  -O $ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/files/$CLUSTER/boot/disk-installer/scibian9/netboot.tar.gz
----

////
NOTE: the installer can be removed from this section once this bug is fixed:
  https://github.com/edf-hpc/puppet-hpc/issues/102
////

The iPXE ROM must be built from sources downloaded on
http://ipxe.org/[iPXE website]:

----
# wget https://git.ipxe.org/ipxe.git/snapshot/HEAD.tar.gz -O $ADMIN/ipxe.tar.gz
# tar -C $ADMIN -xzf $ADMIN/ipxe.tar.gz
# cd $ADMIN/ipxe-*/src
# make bin/undionly.kpxe
# cp bin/undionly.kpxe $ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/files/$CLUSTER/boot/ipxe/ipxe_noserial.bin
----

The `ipxe_serial.bin` variant must be generated after modifying hard-coded
serial console parameters in iPXE source code as documented in
http://ipxe.org/console[iPXE official documentation].

////
NOTE: the iPXE ROM can be removed from this section once this bug is fixed:
  https://github.com/edf-hpc/puppet-hpc/issues/67
////

The iPXE menu boot entries are generated dynamically, depending on the source
node name, by the CGI Python script
`$ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/files/$CLUSTER/boot/cgi/bootmenu.py`:

[source,python]
----
include::../../examples/bootmenu.py[]
----

////
NOTE: the bootmenu can be removed from this section once this bug is fixed:

Debian installer partman utility requires a partition schema with rules and
constraints to create the disk partitions. This file must is located in
`$ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/files/$CLUSTER/boot/disk-installer/scibian9/partition-schema`.
Here is a complete example for this file:

[source]
----
include::../../examples/partition-schema[]

Finally, the version bind9 DNS server available in Debian Jessie is not able to
automatically listen for incoming connections to IP addresses configured after
the daemon has started. This is annoying when virtual IP addresses are gathered
to failover a failing generic service node. This behaviour is workaround with
the following script located in
`$ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/files/$CLUSTER/ha/rndc_reload.sh`:

[source,sh]
----
include::../../examples/rndc_reload.sh[]
----

This script is run when the virtual IP addresses move from one generic service
node to another. It asks bind9 daemon to reload its configuration which also
makes it listen on new IP addresses.
