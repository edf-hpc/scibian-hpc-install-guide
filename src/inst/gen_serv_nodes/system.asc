=== Base system installation

The other generic service nodes must now be rebooted in PXE mode to run the
Debian installer and configure the base system:

[source,sh]
----
for BMC in $(nodeset -e bmcfbservice[2-4]); do
    ipmitool -I lanplus -U ADMIN -P ADMIN -H $BMC chassis bootdev pxe
    ipmitool -I lanplus -U ADMIN -P ADMIN -H $BMC power reset
done
----

Replace the BMC credentials with the appropriate values.

////
FIXME: it would be nice to replace these ipmitool commands with a new high-level
software as discussed in https://github.com/edf-hpc/clara/issues/58
////

Once the base system is fully installed, the nodes reboot and become available
with SSH. Check this with:

----
# clush -bw fbservice[2-4] uname
---------------
fbservice[2-4] (3)
---------------
Linux
----
