== MAC address change

This procedure explains how to modify the Puppet-HPC configuration to change an
hardware Ethernet address after a motherboard replacement, for example.

First, the yaml file in the hieradata repository containing the
`master_network` hash must be edited to replace the old hardware address. A
description of this hash can be found in the Installation section of this guide.

The modified configuration must be pushed to the shared administration
directory with the `hpc-config-push` command:

----
# hpc-config-push
INFO: creating archive /tmp/puppet-config-push/tmp_ndq0ujz/puppet-config-environment.tar.xz
INFO: S3 push: pushing data in bucket s3-system
----

Then apply the configuration on the `service` nodes, who runs the DHCP server:

----
# hpc-config-apply
----

NOTE: It is not possible to run the `hpc-config-apply` command on all the
service nodes at the same time exactly. A short delay must be respected as the
Ceph service can be disturbed by a restart of the network service.
