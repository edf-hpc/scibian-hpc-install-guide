== Requirements

There are a few requirements before starting up the cluster installation. This
section aims to inventory all of these requirements, with example values.

NOTE: For the sake of simplicity, the examples values are used all along the
rest of the installation procedure documentation in various commands or code
excerpts. These examples values must be replaced with values corresponding to
your environment where appropriate.

|Network interfaces configuration of all the nodes and equipments
|Please refer to the <<img-ex_srv_nodes_netifs,following diagram>> for an
example of generic service network configuration.

[[note-internal-repo]]
NOTE: The deployment of Scibian HPC cluster is mainly based on
http://edf-hpc.github.io/puppet-hpc/[Puppet-HPC]. As explained in the _Software
Architecture_ chapter of Puppet-HPC documentation, it works in combination with
an internal configuration repository containing all configuration settings and
data specific to your organization. This Git repository does not have to be
populated to proceed the installation. If it is empty, the <<inst-internalrepo,
Internal repository>> section of this chapter explains how to initialize it from
scratch for Puppet-HPC.

[[note-areas-subnets]]
NOTE: The advanced network topologies support on Scibian HPC clusters,
including subnetworks and areas, relies on the features provided by Puppet-HPC
stack. For more details about areas concept and subnetworking possibilities,
please refer to _Puppet-HPC Reference Documentation_ (chapter
_Software Architecture_, section _Cluster Definition_).

This diagram represents an exemple network interfaces configuration for the
generic services nodes of a Scibian HPC cluster:
