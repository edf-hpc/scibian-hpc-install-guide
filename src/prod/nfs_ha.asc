=== Starting a node

When a node start is should not start the keepalived service automatically.
This permits a failed node to be started without it becoming master with an
remaining problem.

Before starting the *keepalived* service, the following conditions must be met:

 - The *multipath-tools* service must be active with a running `multipathd`
   process.
 - The *keepalived* service must be disabled

When these conditions are met, the service can be started:

----
# systemctl start keepalived
----

If the node is to become master (master node in the VIP configuration or other
node is down), check that the first check goes well. It runs every minutes and
logs are in `/var/log/user.log`. The message following message must appear:

----
Mar 17 17:19:01 fbnfs1 hpc_nfs_ha_server_check.sh.info: INFO: fbnfs1 All checks are OK
----

=== Manual Fail Over

If the master node disappears, because it is turned off or because the
keepalived service is stopped, the failover will happen, but it will take a bit
of time (a little more than a minute). This timeout can be entirely avoided by
doing a manual failover of the master node before cutting the keepalived
service.

To do this, the keepalived configuration must be changed manually on the node.
Edit the file `/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf`. Find the configuration for the
NFS VIP and change the priority to 40, and the role to `BACKUP`. The service
must be reloaded:

----
# service keepalived reload
----

The failover should happen quickly. Once the node failed over, stop the
keepalived service:

----
# systemctl stop keepalived
----

The original configuration must be restored before starting the service again.
This will happen if you launch a *hpc-config-apply* manually or if you reboot
the node.
