=== Scibian diskless initrd

==== The scibian-diskless-initramfs-config package

This package contains the necessary configuration in order to build an initramfs
disk suitable for Scibian diskless nodes. It depends on the following packages:

* initramfs-tools
* live-torrent
* live-boot
* mdadm
* parted

===== initramfs-tools

`Initramfs-tools` is a Debian package that provides tools to create a bootable
initramfs for Linux kernel packages. The initramfs is a compressed cpio
archive. At boot time, the  kernel unpacks that archive into RAM, mounts and
uses it as the initial root file system. The mounting of the real root file 
system occurs in early user space.

===== live-boot

The `live-boot` package provides support for live systems. It depends on the
`live-boot-initramfs-config` package, which is a backend for live-boot in
initramfs config. In particular, it provides the "live" script in
__/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/live__. This script is copied in the
generated initramfs and can download and unpack live system images used as the
root filesystem for diskles nodes.

===== live-torrent

The `live-torrent` package provides support for bitorrent downloading for live
systems. It depends on the `live-torrent-initramfs-tools` package, which
provides the `ctorrent` binary (a bitorrent client) in the initramfs.

==== Generating the initramfs

With the packages described above installed on a Scibian system, it is posible
to generate an initramfs able to download the root live system image via the
bitorrent protocol.

On a Scibian HPC cluster, it is recommanded to use the `Clara` tool to generate
the root live system image, and to generate the corresponding initramfs.
It is possible to specify in the Clara configuration file which packages are
mandatory in the image before generating the initramfs.

Here is an example of the "images" section of the Clara configuration file:

----
[images]
files_to_remove=/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules,/root/.bash_history,/etc/hostname
etc_hosts=10.0.0.1:service,10.0.0.2:admin1
extra_packages_image=hpc-config-apply,scibian-hpc-compute
packages_initrd=scibian-diskless-initramfs-config
----

With this configuration, `Clara` follows these steps to generate the initramfs:

. Uncompress the squashfs image
. Chroot in the directory created
. Install the packages defined by the `packages_initrd` key in the Clara config file
. Generate the initramfs
. Do not recompress the squashfs image

This method is used to guarantee consistency with the kernel in the squashfs
image. It is also possible to generate an initramfs for an image based on
Scibian9 with a machine installed on Scibian8, for example.
