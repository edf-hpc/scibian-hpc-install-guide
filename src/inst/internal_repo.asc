== Internal configuration repository

The internal configuration repository required by Puppet-HPC is designed to be
shared upon multiple clusters in an organization. Then, it has to be initialized
only for the first cluster installation. Its structure and content is fully
explained in the _Software Architecture_ chapter of Puppet-HPC documentation.

This section provides examples configurations snippets to quickstart this
internal configuration repository from scratch.
