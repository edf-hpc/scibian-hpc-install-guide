== Administration node re-installation

This procedure will wipe the first disk of the admin node, if some
customizations are not in the Puppet configuration, this should be handled
separately.

Before, powering off the administration node, check that:

- There is an alternative route to connect to the service node (can be the
  service nodes themselves)
- It is possible to connect to the BMC IPMI, and especially to the Serial Over
  LAN console
- It is possible to connect to the Ethernet administration network switch

The administration node has no critical service in the reference architecture,
so it can simply be powered off:

----
# poweroff
----

NOTE: In some Ethernet bonding setups, the node cannot do a PXE boot with an
active bonding configuration on the Ethernet switch. If this is the case, refer
to the documentation of the network switch to disable the bonding configuration.

To be re-installed, the administration node must perform a network boot. This
can be configured with `ipmitool(1)` installed on a host that has access to the
BMC network interface:

----
# ipmitool -I lanplus -H <bmc host> -U <bmc username> -P chassis bootdev pxe
# ipmitool -I lanplus -H <bmc host> -U <bmc username> -P chassis power on
----

Next steps will happen once the node is installed and has rebooted, the
installation can be followed through serial console:

----
# ipmitool -I lanplus -H <bmc host> -U <bmc username> -P sol activate
----

NOTE: If the Ethernet switch configuration had to be modified to setup PXE boot,
the modification must be reverted to its nominal status.
