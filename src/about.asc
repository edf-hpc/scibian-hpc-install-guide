= About this document

== Purpose

The present document presents the reference architecture, the bootstrap and
installation procedures and use cases of an HPC system called Scibian HPC.

The main goal is to provide exhaustive information regarding the
configuration and system settings based on the needs expressed by users.
This information may be useful to business and technical stakeholders,
as well as to all members of the scientific computing community at EDF.

== Structure

This document is divided into six chapters:

1. About this document: refers to the present chapter.

2. Reference architecture: gives an overview of the software and hardware
architecture of a Scibian HPC system. It also includes a detailed description
of the boot sequence of the HPC System and some other advanced topics.

3. Use-Cases: refers to Use Cases scenarios of the Scibian HPC system.
This chapter describes the different processes and "business activities"
of the Company as well as the functional requirements as they were
expressed by the end users or their managers.

4. Installation procedures: describes how to install the Puppet-HPC
software stack used to configure the administration and generic nodes of
the HPC system. This chapter also explains how to use Ceph for sharing
the configuration files across all the nodes and how to handle the virtual
machines providing all the services needed to operate the HPC system.

5. Bootstrap procedures: contains all the procedures to boostrap all
the crucial services for the Scibian HPC system: LDAP, Ceph, MariaDB with
Galera, SlurmDBD, etc.

6. Production procedures: contains all the technical procedures to follow for
regular operations occuring during the production phase of the supercomputer.
This notably includes changing any encryption or authentication key,
changing passwords, reinstalling nodes, etc.

== Typographic conventions

The following typographic conventions are used in this document:

* Files or directories names are written in italics:
__/admin/restricted/config-puppet__.
* Hostnames are written in bold: *genbatch1*.
* Groups of hostnames are written using
https://github.com/cea-hpc/clustershell/wiki/nodeset[the nodeset syntax from
clustershell].
For example, *genbatch[1-2]* refers to the servers *genbatch1* and *genbatch2*.
* Commands, configuration files contents or source code files are set off
visually from the surrounding text as shown below:

 $ cp /etc/default/rcS /tmp

== Build dependencies

On a Debian Jessie system, these packages must be installed to build this
documentation:

* asciidoctor >= 0.1.4
* asciidoctor-edf-tpl-latex >= 2.0
* inkscape
* rubber
* texlive-latex-extra

// TODO: edf-doc-materials is not provided in a custom Debian Jessie,
// we need to provide an alternative way to build the documentation
