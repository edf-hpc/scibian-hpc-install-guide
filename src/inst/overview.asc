== Overview

The installation process of a Scibian HPC cluster starts with the administration
cluster of the <<arch,reference architecture>>. The administration cluster is
composed of the admin node and a pool of generic services nodes. The generic
services nodes run the base services required by all nodes, then they are the
entry point of the installation procedure.

The first generic service node takes the role of the temporary installation in
order to install all the other generic service nodes. When the generic services
nodes are fully operational with the base software services stack, the admin
node is installed. Then, the process continues with the services virtual
machines and the set of additional services are installed.

Finally, the frontend and compute nodes of the userspace cluster are deployed
and all the additional services are setup to make the Scibian HPC cluster fully
operational.
