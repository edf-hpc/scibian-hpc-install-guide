=== Deleting a Virtual Machine

A Virtual Machine is composed of two mostly independant objects:

- The disk image
- The definition on a host

The two objects must be deleted separately.

The first step is to stop the Virtual Machine:

----
# clara virt stop <vm_name>
----

Once it is in the state `SHUTOFF` you can undefine it:

----
# clara virt undefine <vm_name>
----

The VM will still appear on `clara virt list` with the state: `MISSING`. It
means clara still sees the disk image but not the Virtual Machine definition.

You can then proceed with deleting the disk image, by checking the full disk
image name with `clara virt list --details`, you must find the volume name
and the pool name.

On a physical host:
----
# virsh vol-delete --pool <pool_name> <volume_name>
----

On all other physical hosts:
----
# virsh pool-refresh <pool_name>
----
