== Temporary installation node

The first step of the installation process is to install the first generic
service node. This node will ensure the role of temporary installation node for
the other generic service nodes. Before the admin node is installed, all
operations (unless explicitely stated) are realized on this temporary
installation node.

=== Base installation

Install Debian 8 Jessie base system using any of the official Debian
installation media (CD, DVD, USB key, PXE server, etc) at your convenience.
Configure the network interfaces with static IP addresses in compliancy with
the cluster IP adressing plan. Set the hostname following the
<<arch-conventions,architecture conventions>>, for example: `fbservice1`.

Once the node has rebooted on freshly installed system, add the Scibian 8 APT
repositories to the configuration:

----
# echo <<EOF >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/scibian9.list
deb http://scibian.org/repo/ scibian9 main
EOF
----

Download and enable Scibian repository keyring:

----
# wget https://scibian.org/repo/scibian-auto-keyring.pub -O- | apt-key add -
----

Update the packages repositories local database:

----
# apt-get update
----

Install the following Scibian HPC administration node meta-package:

----
# apt-get install scibian-hpc-admin
----

[[inst-temp-adminenv]]
=== Administration environment

All the files manipulated during the installation process will be placed into a
dedicated working directory. The location of this directory is arbitrary, for
example: `~root/install`. This directory will be designated as `$ADMIN` in the
following section of the installation procedure documentation.

----
# export ADMIN=~root/install
# mkdir $ADMIN && cd $ADMIN
----

Clone both Puppet-HPC and internal configuration repositories into this
dedicated working directory:

----
# git clone https://github.com/edf-hpc/puppet-hpc.git
# git clone ssh://forge/hpc-privatedata.git
----

At this stage, the internal repository can be populated with all files and data
initially required to install the cluster.
