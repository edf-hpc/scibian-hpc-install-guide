=== Temporary installation services

The goal of this section is to configure the Temporary Installation Services on
the Temporary Installation Node. This process is done in two steps:

- A First Run only using local files or external services
- A Second Run reconfiguring the Temporary Installation Node to use the
  services setup during the First Run with values that will also be used to
  install the other generic nodes remotely.

The reference architecture (with Ceph/S3) does not uses the local apache server
in the final configuration. Some other architectures uses a local apache
Virtual Host instead of Ceph/S3 ('profiles::http::system'). If this is the
case, `/var/www/html` can be replaced by
`hiera('profiles::http::system::docroot')` and `http.service` by
`web-system.service` in the `private_files_dir` URL.

=== First Run

Consul is not available because the consul cluster needs quorum to work. Quorum
can only be achieved when more than half of the generic service nodes are
configures. The DNS server is therefore configured to only returns the
temporary installation node for all requests on the consul domain. This is done
simply by adding temporarily the following parameters in file
`$ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/hieradata/$CLUSTER/cluster.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
dns::server::virtual_relay: false
install_server_ip: '10.1.0.1' # static IP address of the temporary
                              # installation node on the administration
                              # network
----

Technically speaking, these parameters makes bind authorative on the _virtual_
DNS zone before Consul service discovery utility is available. The virtual zone
contains all the symbolic names to the network services (_ex:_ `http.virtual`).
This way, all services will be directed to the temporary installation node with
the IP address provided in `install_server_ip` parameter.

The first run also needs to work properly without a local DNS server and
without a local repository cache proxy. These service will be configured during
this first run. Local repositories must also be disabled during the first run.

[source,yaml]
----
private_files_dir: "file:///var/www/html/hpc-config/%{environment}/latest/files"
apt::proxy_host:   ''
profiles::dns::client::nameservers:
  - '172.16.1.1' # External DNS server
hpcconfig::push::config_options:
  global:
    cluster:     "%{hiera('cluster_name')}"
    mode:        'posix'
    destination: "/var/www/html/hpc-config"
----

The configuration will be pushed on local files while the temporary
installation is used. The settings above configures this, but the first push
must use a configuration that will be created manually in the file:
`/etc/hpc-config/push.conf`.

---
[global]
environment=production
version=latest
destination=/var/www/html/hpc-config
cluster=<CLUSTER NAME>
mode=posix
---

The directory where the keys where generated cannot be used as a key source for
apply because it will be overwritten during the apply. So it must be copied
before doing the apply. To deploy the configuration of the temporary
installation node, run the following commands:

----
# cd $ADMIN
# hpc-config-push
# cp -a /etc/puppet/secure/keys keys
# hpc-config-apply --source file:///var/www/html/hpc-config \
                   --keys-source=file://$ADMIN/keys \
                   --verbose
# rm -rf $ADMIN/keys
----

=== Second Run

At this stage the unique temporary installation node should work, the
configuration is modified to use it. The following hiera keys must be changed
in file `$ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/hieradata/$CLUSTER/cluster.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
private_files_dir: "http://http.service.%{hiera('virtual_domain')}/hpc-config/%{environment}/latest/files"
# apt:proxy_host is left to the default values
# profiles::dns::client::nameservers is configured as detailed above
----

Check the new settings with:

----
# cd $ADMIN
# hpc-config-push
# hpc-config-apply --verbose
----

If the two commands run without error, the initial setup succeeded.

At this stage, the temporary installation service are fully configured and
available to install other generic service nodes.
