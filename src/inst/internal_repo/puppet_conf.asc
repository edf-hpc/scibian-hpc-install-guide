=== Puppet configuration

The `hpc-config-push` Puppet-HPC utility expects to find a Puppet and Hiera
configuration files for the cluster under the `puppet-config` directory of the
internal configuration repository. Simply copy examples configuration files
provided with Puppet-HPC:

[source,bash]
----
cp $ADMIN/puppet-hpc/examples/privatedata/{puppet.conf,hiera.yaml} \
   $ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/puppet-config/$CLUSTER/
----

The `hiera.yaml` file notably specifies the layers of YAML files composing the
hiera repository. It can eventually be tuned for additional layer to fit your
needs.

Puppet-HPC requires the cluster name and prefix to be a declared a YAML file
`cluster-nodes.yaml`. Technically speaking, this YAML file is deployed by
`hpc-config` utilities on every nodes in `/etc/hpc-config` directory. It is
then used as aconfiguration input file for the external node classifer
(https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/nodes_external.html[ENC])
`cluster-node-classifier` provided with `hpc-config`. Define the file
`$ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/puppet-config/$CLUSTER/cluster-nodes.yaml` with the
following content:

[source,yaml]
----
---
cluster_name:   foobar
cluster_prefix: fb
----

If the cluster is composed of multiple _areas_, they must also be declared in
this YAML file with their associated roles. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
areas:
  infra:
    - admin
    - service
  user:
    - front
    - cn
----

In this declaration, the _admin_ and _service_ roles are membered of the
_infra_ area, the _front_ and _cn_ roles are membered of the _user_ area.
