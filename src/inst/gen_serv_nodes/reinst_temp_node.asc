=== Temporary installation node sweep

Since the beginning of the installation process, the temporary installation node
hosts installation files and services required to install the other generic
service nodes. Now, all the other generic service nodes host the same files and
services. Finally, the temporary installation node must be re-installed to be
strictly identical to the other generic service nodes in terms of configuration.

NOTE: The disks of the temporary installation node are going to be formatted and
all data hosted of this node will be lost. Then, it is probably time to backup
all the manual modifications realized on this node and push all modifications in
the remote internal configuration Git repository.

Reboot the node in PXE mode through its BMC:

----
# export BMC=bmcfbservice1
# ipmitool -I lanplus -U ADMIN -P ADMIN -H $BMC chassis bootdev pxe
# ipmitool -I lanplus -U ADMIN -P ADMIN -H $BMC power reset
----

Wait for the network installation to proceed and the node to reboot on the
system freshly installed on its disks.
