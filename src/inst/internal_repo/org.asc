=== Organization settings

Some settings are common to all HPC clusters of an organization, in particular
settings regarding the <<arch-extsrv,external services>>. To avoid duplication
of these settings in all HPC cluster configurations, they are defined once in
the organization layer of the hiera repository shared by all HPC clusters.

IMPORTANT: This step must be done only once for the organization. It can be
skipped safely if the organization layer YAML file already exists.

Initialize the file `$ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/hieradata/org.yaml` with the
following content:

[source,yaml]
----
include::../../examples/initial_org.yaml[]
----

NOTE: This configuration supposes the APT, NTP, SMTP, DNS and LDAP settings are
similar on all the HPC clusters of your organization. This might not be true in
some specific organization environments. In this case, the settings of the
affected services must be defined in the cluster specific layers of the hiera
repository instead.

The examples values must be replaced with the settings corresponding to your
organization environment.
