=== Temporary installation services

At this stage, the pool of generic service nodes with the base services in
cluster mode are not yet available. The temporary installation node has to be
fully autonomous in hosting the base services. This is done simply by adding
temporarily the following parameters in file
`$ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/hieradata/$CLUSTER/cluster.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
dns::server::virtual_relay: false
install_server_ip: '10.1.0.1' # static IP address of the temporary
                              # installation node on the administration
                              # network
----

Technically speaking, these parameters makes bind authorative on the _virtual_
DNS zone before Consul service discovery utility is available. The virtual zone
contains all the symbolic names to the network services (_ex:_ `http.virtual`).
This way, all services will be directed to the temporary installation node with
the IP address provided in `install_server_ip` parameter.

To deploy the configuration of the temporary installation node, run the
following commands:

----
# hpc-config-push
# hpc-config-apply --source file:///var/www/html/hpc-config \
                   --keys-source=file:///etc/puppet/secure/keys \
                   --verbose
----

Then, adjust the `private_files_dir` location in file
`$ADMIN/hpc-privatedata/hieradata/$CLUSTER/cluster.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
private_files_dir: "http://http.service.%{hiera('virtual_domain')}/hpc-config/%{environment}/latest/files"
----

Check the new settings with:

----
# hpc-config-push
# hpc-config-apply --verbose
----

If the two commands run without error, the initial setup succeeded.

At this stage, the temporary installation service are fully configured and
available to install other generic service nodes.
